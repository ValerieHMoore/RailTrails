# RailTrails

Welcome to RailTrails! Many abandoned railroad lines have been changed into recreational trails for bicycling, walking, horseback riding, snowmobiling, etc. They typically have gentle grades, wildlife, and scenic views.

This app allows you to enter your zip code and get a list of trails near you. Then you can choose one of the trails on the list to see more details: length in miles, state(s) where it’s located, surface (gravel, paved, etc.), endpoints, and a full description of the trail. Happy Trails!

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'RailTrails'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install RailTrails

## Usage

1. Go to the terminal prompt and cd to the bin directory.
2. Type ruby railtrails to start the program.
3. Follow the prompts to enter your zip code.
4. Once the list of rail trails comes up, follow the prompt to choose a rail trail and get more details about it.
5. Follow the prompts to start over with another zip code or exit the program.
6. Have fun and Happy Trails!

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
